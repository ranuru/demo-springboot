# Report DAT250 Experiment 3

# Issues
- No technical problems
- Biggest challenges were:
  - combining the frontend and the backend. Issues in how I designed the backend in the last assignment reappeared
    - in particular: how votes were handled. I had to go back to the backend and change how votes were handled to accommodate for the frontend, which I would assume is not optimal
  - Understanding how to use svelte. I have no experience in javascript or any other frontend language, so this was very new for me.
